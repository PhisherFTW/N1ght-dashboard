            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Don’t get distracted by teammates’ calls causing you not to follow through with the correct protocols such as clearing angles or dropping useful utility or taking care when rotating.</li>
                    <li>Getting kill hungry and going to kills that don’t actively benefit the round and just are there to pad your score but could potentially cause you to have a weak buy the following round or turn the round into the enemy's favour.</li>
                    <li>When peeking an angle never jump into an angle as you are inaccurate for a time after you land and are unable to shoot and thus causing a delay in TTD (time to damage) which is never good.</li>
                    <li>Impatient when holding good angles for the duration of the game you hardly ever held a useful angle longer than 10 seconds because you were constantly switching.</li>
                    <li>Crouching to stop instead of using counter-strafing which causes you to shoot later and completely removes your movement from the engagement making it much easier for the enemy to predict exactly where you head will be.</li>
                    <li>Throwing away your positional advantage for a marginally better position which left you completely out in the open.</li>
                    <li>Do not hold fading smokes as the enemy in the smoke will always have a big advantage.</li>
                    <li>Don’t get used to not using cover because although off-angle are good if there is a second to trade your first kill without cover is drastically decreases your chance of getting the second kill.</li>
                    <li>Do not overcommit to fights and expose yourself to multiple enemies this drastically decreases your chances of getting kills and allows them a higher chance of instantly killing you.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your crosshair is locked onto the enemy before you start shooting, a few times I noticed you started shooting before your crosshair was not on the enemy before you started shooting.</li>
                    <li>When taking engagements you take the first one that pops into your mind this isn’t nessecarily bad but it makes a lot of your peeks extremely predictable and that is why during quite a few of your engagements it feels like you can barely react before the enemies kill you</li>
                    <li>Practise Multi-strafing as in a few situations in would have been very beneficial for you and could have prevented you dying as well as increased the number of kill you got. youtube: </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>armour, good use of jumping on pistol round to prevent headshots, and solid first kill on the enemy market and you were going to do the right thing initially by checking deeper into market but because of external info you flicked back towards site which was a very bad idea as you had not cleared market, fortunately for you the enemy peeking you from market missed their first 2 shots on you which they should have hit at their level, and you managed to flick back and get the instant headshot but which was good mechanically but focus on clearing the angle which have the most impact on you initially before trying to help teammates like market in this situation, which do you eventually do after dealing with the second enemy market. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good peek into middle and solid damage onto the window enemy, good protocol to instantly Molly windows to prevent further peeking and allow your team to take middle fortunately your teammate had the same idea and you were able to save your Molly, nice angle clearing into connector, and solid kill on the enemy connector, good use of the connector stairs to create a headshot angle onto triple and quickly deal with the enemy there, when spotting the last enemy you were greedy and you attempt a mulistrafe peek into the last enemy CT and because it wasn't executed properly and your peek was extremely predictable they managed to handle you with decent crosshair placement. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when clearing lowers I don't recommend jumping onto the wood as it takes a little bit before you are fully accurate after landing from a jump instead peek it from the top of the stairs this also creates a sort of headshot angle making the fight harder for the enemy peeking lowers, when moving through apps your jump to cross windows is okay but you need to look out the windows as this gets you information as did this round you just ran looking at van until the end of the second window apps and only then looked at sight this caused you to be unaware of enemies peeking apps from site and taking a bit of damage, nice peek from balcony and good crosshair placement for headshot back site bit, unfortunately, the enemy was peeking from empty instead, and this forced you to flick, and you started shooting before your crosshair was on the enemy and spray 4 bullets none of which hit the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>full buy, nice window smoke, nice movement to sneak into ladder room and nice adjustment onto the enemy peeking from catwalk, good protocol to smoke cat to allow you to peek from cat to B site without worrying about A site, I like your off-angle holding for an enemy pushing into market from window, unfortunately, you get a little impatient and peek deeper which puts you into an unfavourable engagement and gives away your position but after that you had a good protocol to Molly to delay the enemy push and it allows you to regain the positional advantage with them not knowing exactly where you are, unfortunately, you teammate doesn't watch apps deep enough or doesn't give you the info which gets you killed by the enemy flanking apps, causing your team to lose the round although your team made many mistakes to lose to a half buy. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle Armour, nice top middle control smoke, good attempt at breaking down the angles in the 1v1 but what caused you to lose that was a few factors, you peeked the obvious angle on an obvious timing, basically you took that fight as quickly as you could without any change in elevation or timing or use of utility (you had 1 flash) and because you crouched on the engagement the enemy missed the first 2 bullets but pulled down slightly and it was a headshot for it just standing and taking a different peek: close/normal/wide would have made the fight much much hard for him to win. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle smoke flash, a nice kill on the enemy pushing top middle but I generally don't recommend crouch sliding as although it is accurate it can actually make your shot harder than it needs to be, good trade kill on the enemy pushing catwalk, you get a little bit greedy going for the last enemy on A site but you weren't punished for it and your teammate was close by to trade in case, but this eco win put your team in good place money wise and you were a big part. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good A take, you got no action but your team left the bomb in spawn which you had to collect. They promptly left you in a 1v1 which you lost, do not throw away for positional advantage for a marginally better position as this leaves you open when you were crossing from site to tetris you were walking. Then the enemy peeked from jungle which you were looking at but not fully focused on, this change in position completely lost you your advantage as instead of the CT having to search for you as soon as he peeked the site he saw you, I recommend staying in solid positions like default/ninja/triple as they give you considerable cover good headshot angles and comfortable fights. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, perfect crosshair placement and calling on the enemy catwalk and very nice kill, unfortunately, you were not ready for the enemy sitting in the fading window smoke, generally the enemy sitting in the smoke will have the advantage and I prefer to hide as the smoke fades and repeek once I know they won't have the advantage anymore. L</li>
                    <li>P250, good kill on the enemy under balcony, generally speaking if there is an enemy around default /under balcony and an enemy stairs there won't be an enemy CT for a while, so you can feel quite safe getting the plant down default, unfortunately you decided to try plant triple which is more spammable and requires you to cross in the open which gets you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, once your team had cleared A site and you had established that both were B it was just greedy to try get the kill unfortunately after you give away your position Apps instead of rotating back to backup your teammates you pursue and get yourself killed with no chance of getting traded, also with your teammate middle getting greedy and choosing a bad path this put your team in a 4v2 into a 2v2 and the enemy have the bomb, which your team loses. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle flash, good job not crowding Tetris but unfortunately you get distracted by your teammates swapping weapons and this causes you to die from an enemy peeking bench which is where you should have been holding. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice top con smoke unfortunately your team didn't do a powerful mid take so they couldn't take advantage of the utility but your teammate coming out A managed to clean up, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when crossing jungle you need to be hyper-focused on that angle as that is the most likely angle to deal with Ts crossing to site unfortunately during this round you were hyper-focused on default, 4 seconds after the default player got killed this caused you to take damage from A stairs and jungle player putting you down to 33hp without being able to shoot back, dangerous util drop as you peeked jungle to drop your Molly when you could have landed the same Molly from default this could have caused the enemy to peek you while you had utility out, nice reposition into CT, and good angle from ticket booth to stairs allowing you to get the kill.W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good attempt at early aggression and changing up the pace unfortunately it got shut down with CT mollies and nades, the CTs on this take had the perfect flash and peek timing to deal with the 3 of you around Tetris and there wasn't really anything you could have done. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, tiny bit of unnecessary Molly damage taken, interesting counter flash over the market, no action. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol Armour, a little bit of a slow rotation after your teammates on B confirmed it was a full B take, good attempt at using the USPs accuracy to deal with the enemy bench but because you sat crouch shooting it made it incredibly easy for them to line up a headshot on you with a dropped USP. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, good job getting a kill with the bare usp. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice dropping the connector smoke and almost using it like a 1way to help get the kill on the enemy cat, and nice reaction to kill the enemy pushing through your con smoke. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash middle, and good protocol for the con smoke, teammates slow calls cause a slow rotate allowing the enemies to get into all the best positions making this 3v5 almost impossible, and I would have recommended instantly saving, which would have allowed for your team to have an extremely strong buy going into the next round now it's a bad buy with most players opting to just have upgraded pistols and 1 guy with a hero buy. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle Armour, good job getting the kill on the enemy jumping to top stairs and managing to retrieve his weapon and quickly following that up with a swift double kill fantastic play, giving your team a chance in this round, unfortunately, they do a good amount of damage but just aren't able to pull it off. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, this is still a somewhat messed up buy and it shows how 1 save could have properly prepared you for the following two rounds, good Molly ramp although your middle flash kind of messed up your teammate who seemed to want to go agro middle, good con smoke and fantastic flash dodge timing allowing you to completely nullify the enemies con flash and kill the t pushing through your smoke, your movement and positioning after getting that kill was unfocused and excessive you tried to do too many things and executed none with purpose and kept changing which caused you to wiff on an enemy moving up cat which you should have been ready for. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, your con player dying made you question your positioning and put you in an uncomfortable situation when moving between top con and jungle you did not seem to recognize how much map control the enemies had which caused your crosshair placement to not be in exactly the right place or focused like ladder room or window. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, great double kill on the enemies peeking at you from site you took each engagement calmly and focused, which allowed you to deal with each enemy quickly while taking minimal damage, good timing peeking top stairs after you heard the enemy shoot the awp and to backup your teammate trust and get your third kill, also good job realizing a triple awp setup wasn't feasible and switching back to a rifle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good idea to nade towards middle, unfortunately, your lineup was slightly off but if it would have landed thY would have been a great nade, good peek timing to catch the enemy peeking out palace and deal with him swiftly, and great positioning and patience to get thr trade on the enemy bench. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when moving up from cat I recommend trying to get up to the pillar as it is your only piece of cover, unfortunately, you put too much space between yourself and cover and this allowed the awp to get a free shot on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good damage on the enemy top middle, and solid peek on thr enemy palace, very nice nade into ramp doing at least 100 damage. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, over-committing to the ramp fight from top stairs left you completely exposed to the enemies in palace which swiftly dealt with you not looking at them. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, getting greedy pushing into middle when as the con player it is your job to deal with lowers but as you pushed up middle the lowers enemies pushed and killed you and your window and short player taking your advantage from a 5v2 to a 2v2. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action, good info on the enemy pushing through window and nice slow retake. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dropping utility while exposed to the angle palace instead of from a sage position could have caused you to die, nice trade on the enemy ramp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little slow to realize it was an A push after the enemy extinguished your smoke, which almost led to the catching you off guard but fortunately you were ready for the bottom stairs peek and secured that kill cleanly, but then you were greedy and overly aggressive which put you out in the open with no cover and no real idea of where the enemies were, fortunately, your teammate called one of their positions and you relied on you mechanics to get you that kill but swiftly after you got traded by the remaining enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfocused holding of an angle and moving caused your time to damage to be very slow on the enemy peeking you on cat which allowed him to easily secure the kill on you I recommend once you have chosen an angle to hold don't just randomly change it instead focus on holding it until you are sure that Noone will be and don't move for no reason as this requires you to perform a proper counterstrike before you are able to shoot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you keep over-exposing yourself to palace when you peek into ramp even when you have a ramp player this has gotten you punished a few times in this game, I recommend just focusing on the angle you are meant to hold and have some faith in your teammates’ ability to go 1 for 1, during this round after your teammate died you overexposed yourself again and when you peeked into ramp someone was out palace and 3 were put tetris. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job getting out of palace and solid kill on the enemy on site, your basic mechanics are good and you rely heavily on them for the vast majority of your kills, but one of your habits that keeps losing you duels is your Crouching to stop yourself which is slower than counter strafing and restricts your movement heavily that means in every fight you take either you die or they die there is no possibility for ducking behind cover or using movement to your advantage at all after the initial contact and that gets you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you started shooting before your crosshair was locked onto the enemy that wasn't looking at you and if you think there is any chance you won't kill him that's fine your position is still completely unknown and there are many enemies you could have lined up a different one, also when falling back lowers you should never turn your back to the enemies and keep your weapon out, halfway through the tunnel you pulled out your knife and tried to run away and as soon as the enemy peeked there was no chance for escape. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, huge nade damage taken not much you could do to avoid it, unfortunately entrying with full utility and no flashes caused you to instantly get picked by an awp holding apps. L</li>
